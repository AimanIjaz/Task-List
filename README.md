# Local Storage: 
Tasks are stored in the browser's local storage, allowing the application to retain tasks even after the page is refreshed or closed. This ensures that tasks persist between sessions.

# DOMContentLoaded Event: 
The application listens for the DOMContentLoaded event, ensuring that tasks stored in local storage are loaded and displayed when the page is loaded or refreshed.

The application defines UI elements such as forms, task lists, input fields, and buttons, providing a user-friendly interface for managing tasks.
